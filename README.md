# transport-JAVA-course-1
This Git repository contains a Java implementation of a simple class hierarchy. Within this project, you'll find various Java classes organized in a hierarchical structure. These classes are designed to illustrate fundamental object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

practice-1:
Create a class hierarchy. Topic for your hierarchy will be provided by your mentors.
Requirements:
- At least 10 classes
- All classes must contain properties (minimum 1)
- At least 5 private properties (in total, in any classes)
- All private variables must have getters and setters.
- All classes should have at least one custom constructor
- Create separate class with main() which will instantiate objects of implemented classes.

practice-2:
Extended your previous homework with next features:
Requirements:
- Use polymorphism with at least one abstract class.
- Create and override at least one abstract method.
- Use protected modifier at least 5 times
- Override methods from class Object (toString(), hashcode(), equals()) for at least 3 classes from the hierarchy.

practice-3:
- Add 5 interfaces to the existing hierarchy.
- Use polymorphism with the abstract class and interface from the hierarchy.
- Create final class, method, variable. 
- Create a static block, method, variable.

practice-4:
- Create 5 custom exceptions.
- Handle exceptions in 2 ways. 
- Use try-catch with resources.
- Log messages to the console, file.

practice-5:
- Add 5 collections to the hierarchy. 
- Create custom LinkedList with generic.
